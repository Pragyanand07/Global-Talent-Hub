The project is a web-based job listing scraper and viewer that allows users to identify job opportunities requiring proficiency in specific languages. The user enters the URL of a job listing webpage, and the system analyzes its content to detect mentions of targeted languages. If jobs matching the criteria are found, they are displayed in a styled, responsive interface. Otherwise, the user is informed that no relevant listings were found.
